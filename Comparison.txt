In general-purpose programming languages, C++ is frequently used. You can use the language to encapsulate both high-level and low-level language elements. As a result, it is classified as an intermediate language. It's also utilized to create sophisticated systems that necessitate hardware-level coding.

Python is an object-oriented programming language with a high level of abstraction. It comes with built-in data structures, as well as dynamic binding and typing, making it an excellent choice for rapid application development. Modules and packages are also supported by Python, allowing for system modularity and code reuse.

The Key Differences 

1. C++ is a compiled programming language. From the C++ source code, the C++ compiler generates object code, which is then run to produce the result. Python is a scripting language. Python code with the py extension does not need to be built. We can pass it directly to the Python interpreter and get the results.

2. Memory management in C++ is done manually. C++ does not support automatic resource garbage collection. Python, on the other hand, has a garbage collection capability built in. Its memory management is managed by the operating system.

3. Data types in C++ are associated with names and checked at compile time. This decreases the chance of any runtime issues. The data types in Python are bound to values and checked at runtime. Because we don't catch problems at compile time, code may be more error-prone at runtime.

4. Rapid prototyping is achievable in Python due to the short size of the code, but it is not possible in C++ due to the greater code size.
